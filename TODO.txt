Plot gene names for last cluster right-justified
Redraw t-SNE using cluster ordering as initial layout (in circle)
Export CSV for Patrik
Organize the level 2 analysis to avoid redundant computations

Use max 10-20% of all cells for enrichment score
Do this also for gene selection in preliminary clustering

Merge clusters based on shared markers with other clusters
    1. identify ghost clusters
    2. find closely related cluster, or trash
    3. renumber and recalculate

* min-pts 10 if <3000 cells, 20 if <20000, else 100
* epsilon_pct 65

dendrogram based on all clusters
    - using trinarization score distance locally?
    - using enriched genes on enrichment score

export trinarization table for all clusters

resample to compute cluster stability

make sure layers are always merged

## Transcriptional velocity

-> get all the data reanalyzed and represented as 4-layer Loom files, float16:
    1. Sum of all (default layer)
    2. Unspliced ("unspliced")
    3. Spliced ("spliced")
    4. Ambiguous ("ambiguous")

## development

-> back-port multiscale KNN to level 1
