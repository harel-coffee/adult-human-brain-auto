Plot gene names for last cluster right-justified
Redraw t-SNE using cluster ordering as initial layout (in circle)
Merge clusters based on edge distribution
dendrogram based on all clusters
    - using trinarization score distance locally?
    - using enriched genes on enrichment score
export trinarization table for all clusters
resample to compute cluster stability
make sure layers are always merged

x Export CSV for Patrik
x Organize the level 2 analysis to avoid redundant computations
x Use max 10-20% of all cells for enrichment score
x Do this also for gene selection in preliminary clustering
x min-pts 10 if <3000 cells, 20 if <20000, else 100
x epsilon_pct 65
x back-port multiscale KNN to level 1

## Transcriptional velocity

-> get all the data reanalyzed and represented as 4-layer Loom files, float16:
    1. Sum of all (default layer)
    2. Unspliced ("unspliced")
    3. Spliced ("spliced")
    4. Ambiguous ("ambiguous")
