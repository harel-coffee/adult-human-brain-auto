## Requirements

`graphviz`, with the `dot` command available in the $PATH

On Mac, graphviz can be installed using Homebrew. Note; the graphviz provided with Anaconda does not work,
because it wasn't compiled with full support for SFDP layout.

## Installation

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `python setup.py install`
